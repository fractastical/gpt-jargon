+++ pirate-game

A pirate can move up, down, left, or right
The pirate gains 1 point for each gold piece collected
The game lasts for 10 turns
Create a 10x10 grid
Place a pirate ship at a random position on the grid
Place 4 pieces of gold at random positions on the grid, not overlapping with the pirate ship or each other
Initialize a variable called score to 0
For 10 turns:
{
Move the pirate ship in a random direction (up, down, left, or right), making sure it stays within the grid boundaries
If the pirate ship moves onto a position containing a gold piece, increment the score by 1 and remove the gold piece from the grid
